// user-variables.scss
// Use this to overwrite Bootstrap and Theme variables
//


// Example of a variable override to change Front's primary color and font size
// Remove the "//" to comment it in and see it in action!
// $primary: #FF00AE;
// $font-size-base: .875rem;

// Theme's primary color has lighter as well as darker color versions,
// and they also need to be changed upon changing the primary color to a different hex code - otherwise the color of some blocks might look not professional.
// Here is a list of colors that associate these changes:
// $primary-darker:                                              $red;
// $primary-lighter:                                             $red-lighter;
// $info:                                                        $red-lighter;


$theme-colors: (
